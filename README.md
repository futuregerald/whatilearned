# Purpose
What I Learned is a site where people can track what they are reading and learning and studying. I've spent years learning development with a group of friends and we talk and share constantly. This app will allow us to share and track what we are doing with each other, and allow signups for other individuals and teams. This will also make it easier for teams to ask questions, get answers and find resources.
